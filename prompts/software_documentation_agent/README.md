9. Highlight any potential issues, deprecated features, or areas requiring further attention:
    - Use warning or note blocks to draw attention to important information
    - Clearly mark deprecated features and provide migration paths
    - Identify areas where additional documentation or clarification may be needed

10. Implement quality assurance measures:
    - Review generated documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
    - Ensure all links and references are valid and up-to-date
    - Verify that the documentation aligns with the current state of the codebase

11. Consider ethical implications and inclusivity:
    - Use inclusive language and avoid potentially offensive terms
    - Ensure documentation is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., proper heading structure, alt text for images)
    - Respect data privacy and security by not exposing sensitive information in public documentation
</instructions>

<output_format>
