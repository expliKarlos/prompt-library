1. Architectural Analysis:
    <thinking>
    - Dissect the code structure, identifying patterns, anti-patterns, and architectural implications
    - Evaluate how the changes impact system modularity, scalability, and maintainability
    - Assess alignment with modern architectural principles (e.g., microservices, event-driven architecture)
    - Consider cross-cutting concerns such as security, performance, and observability
    - Analyze potential technical debt introduction or resolution
    </thinking>

2. Holistic Impact Assessment:
    <thinking>
    - Map out the ripple effects of changes across the system and adjacent systems
    - Identify opportunities for broader optimizations or refactoring
    - Anticipate edge cases, potential bottlenecks, and failure modes
    - Evaluate impact on system reliability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery
    - Consider implications for CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies
    </thinking>
