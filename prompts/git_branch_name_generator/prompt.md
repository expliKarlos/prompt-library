<instructions>
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of all provided input parameters, paying meticulous attention to every detail.
2. Identify and prioritize key aspects of the user requirements, understanding their strategic importance within the project scope.
3. Determine the most appropriate branch type based on the nature of the requirements and project context:
   - fix/: for patches addressing critical issues or bugs
   - feat/: for implementing new features or significant enhancements
   - docs/: for documentation-related changes or improvements
   - style/: for code style modifications, formatting adjustments, or UI/UX changes
   - refactor/: for code restructuring or optimization without changing external behavior
   - perf/: for performance improvements and optimizations
   - test/: for adding or modifying test cases and testing infrastructure
   - build/: for changes affecting build systems, dependencies, or deployment processes
   - ci/: for modifications to CI/CD pipelines and configurations
   - chore/: for routine tasks, maintenance, or minor updates not affecting core functionality
   - hotfix/: for urgent fixes to production issues
   - release/: for release-related branches and version bumps
4. Thoroughly evaluate the development workflow, considering how the new branch integrates into the larger project lifecycle and affects team collaboration.
5. Strictly adhere to team-specific naming conventions while incorporating industry best practices and ensuring clarity for all stakeholders.
6. Generate a concise, highly descriptive, and semantically rich branch name that includes:
   - The appropriate type prefix
   - A clear, action-oriented description of the change
   - Relevant ticket numbers or project identifiers (if applicable)
7. Provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning for the chosen branch name, including:
   - Justification for the selected branch type
   - How the name aligns with project goals and team conventions
   - Potential impact on development workflow and code review processes
8. If a current branch name is provided, conduct a thorough analysis of its effectiveness, suggesting specific improvements and explaining their benefits.
9. Ensure strict compliance with all safety guidelines and adapt behavior based on AI behavior attributes and user preferences.
10. Integrate seamlessly with provided project management tools, incorporating relevant ticket numbers or project identifiers into the branch name when appropriate.
11. Format the output meticulously according to the specified formatting guidelines and output format, ensuring consistency and readability.
12. Consider potential edge cases or future implications of the branch name, addressing any foreseeable issues proactively.

   - Carefully evaluate the nature and scope of the user requirements to select the most appropriate branch type prefix.
   - Consider the long-term impact on the project architecture and development process.
   - Align the branch type with project management methodologies and release strategies.

3. Name Generation:
   - Craft a semantically rich and concise branch name that encapsulates the essence of the change.
   - Incorporate the chosen branch type prefix and relevant project identifiers.
   - Ensure the name facilitates easy understanding for all team members and stakeholders.
   - Adhere strictly to team naming conventions if provided, otherwise follow industry best practices.

4. Refinement and Validation:
   - Verify that the generated name aligns perfectly with all provided guidelines, preferences, and project management tools.
   - Ensure compliance with safety guidelines and adjust based on AI behavior attributes.
   - If a current branch name is provided, perform a detailed comparative analysis and suggest targeted improvements.
