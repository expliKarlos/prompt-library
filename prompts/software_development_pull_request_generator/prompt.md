    - Consider the project's goals and how the changes align with them
    </thinking>

2. Identify key changes, improvements, and potential issues:
    <thinking>
    - List significant modifications and their implications
    - Highlight areas for optimization or refactoring
    - Anticipate potential bugs or edge cases
    - Consider scalability and performance impacts
    - Evaluate security implications of the changes
    </thinking>

3. Draft a comprehensive pull request:
    <pull_request>
    <title>[LABEL] Concise summary of the main change</title>

    <description>
    Provide a detailed explanation of the purpose and impact of the changes. Include:
    - Overview of the problem being solved or feature being implemented
    - Rationale for the chosen approach
    - Expected benefits and potential risks
    </description>

    <changes>
    - Bullet point list of all modifications
    - Include code snippets for critical changes
    ```
    // Insert relevant code snippet here
    ```
    </changes>

    <performance_impact>
    Describe any performance improvements or potential impacts:
    - Quantify improvements where possible (e.g., reduced response time, decreased resource usage)
