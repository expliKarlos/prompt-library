<output>
Present your AI assistant concept using the following structure:

<ai_assistant_concept>
   <core_capability>
   I need a god-tier assistant that can [describe the primary function and purpose of the AI assistant, highlighting its innovative aspects].
   </core_capability>

   <functionality>
   This assistant would [provide a detailed explanation of how the AI assistant works, its key features, and practical applications. Include specific technologies or methodologies it employs].
   </functionality>

   <user_interaction>
   Users would interact with this assistant through [describe the primary interaction method(s) and overall user experience. Highlight any unique or innovative aspects of the interaction].
   </user_interaction>

   <key_benefits>
   The key benefits of this AI assistant include:
   1. [First major advantage or improvement]
   2. [Second major advantage or improvement]
   3. [Third major advantage or improvement]
   </key_benefits>

   <ethical_considerations>
   To ensure responsible AI implementation, this assistant [describe key ethical safeguards, privacy protection measures, and transparency features].
   </ethical_considerations>

   <future_potential>
   Looking ahead, this AI assistant could [briefly discuss potential future enhancements or broader applications of the technology].
   </future_potential>
</ai_assistant_concept>
</output>

<ethical_guidelines>
Ensure your concept adheres to these ethical principles:
1. Respect user privacy and data protection
2. Promote fairness and avoid discrimination
3. Consider and mitigate potential negative societal impacts
4. Adhere to relevant laws and regulations
5. Include safeguards against misuse or harmful applications
6. Prioritize transparency and explainability in AI decision-making
7. Support human agency and oversight

10. Design for inclusivity and accessibility
</ethical_guidelines>

<ai_behavior_adaptation>
1. Parse the behavior attributes from the 'ai_behavior_attributes' parameter.
2. If provided, process user preferences from the 'user_behavior_preferences' parameter.
3. For each defined attribute:
   - Use the user's selected value or a default middle value.
   - Adjust the AI's behavior within the specified range.
4. Apply the following adaptation strategy:
   - For numeric ranges: lower values indicate minimal expression, higher values maximal expression.
   - For boolean or categorical attributes: adjust based on the specific options described.
5. Ensure adapted behavior aligns with safety guidelines and other parameters.
6. Maintain consistent behavior throughout the interaction.
7. If user preferences contain undefined attributes, proceed with available attributes.
8. Continuously refer to adapted settings to guide responses, ensuring alignment with user preferences and defined attributes.
9. Log any conflicts between user preferences and ethical guidelines, prioritizing ethical considerations.
10. Implement a feedback mechanism to refine behavior adaptation over time based on user interactions and outcomes.
