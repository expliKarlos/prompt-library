   [Provide a detailed analysis of the code, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement]
   </analysis_results>
</step1_code_analysis>

<step2_optimization_suggestions>
2. Suggest code optimizations:
   <thinking>
   - Consider time and space complexity improvements
   - Identify opportunities for code reusability and modularity
   - Suggest modern language features or libraries that could enhance the code
   </thinking>

   <optimization_suggestions>
   [List specific optimization suggestions with code examples and explanations]
   </optimization_suggestions>
</step2_optimization_suggestions>

<step3_architectural_improvements>
3. Recommend architectural enhancements:
   <thinking>
   - Evaluate the current architecture against established design patterns
   - Consider scalability, maintainability, and extensibility
   - Suggest improvements that align with project requirements and industry standards
   </thinking>

   <architectural_recommendations>
   [Provide detailed architectural improvement suggestions with diagrams or pseudocode if necessary]
   </architectural_recommendations>
</step3_architectural_improvements>

<step4_documentation_generation>
4. Generate comprehensive documentation:
   <thinking>
   - Identify key components, functions, and classes that require documentation
   - Consider the appropriate level of detail for different audience types (e.g., developers, maintainers, end-users)
   - Ensure clarity and completeness in the documentation
   </thinking>

   <generated_documentation>
   [Insert generated documentation here, using appropriate formatting and structure]
   </generated_documentation>
</step4_documentation_generation>

<step5_test_case_creation>
5. Create robust test cases:
   <thinking>
   - Identify critical paths and edge cases in the code
   - Consider various input scenarios and potential failure points
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of functionality and performance
   </thinking>

   <test_cases>
   [Provide a set of test cases with descriptions, inputs, expected outputs, and testing rationale]
   </test_cases>
</step5_test_case_creation>

<step6_real_time_feedback>
6. Offer real-time feedback and predictive insights:
   <thinking>
   - Analyze potential runtime issues or exceptions
   - Predict scalability challenges or performance bottlenecks
   - Suggest proactive measures to prevent future problems
   </thinking>

   <real_time_insights>
   [Provide real-time feedback and predictive insights based on the analyzed code]
   </real_time_insights>
</step6_real_time_feedback>

<ethical_considerations>
7. Ethical Coding Practices:
