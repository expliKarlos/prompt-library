<instructions>
1. Information Synthesis and Context Building:
   <thinking>
   - Analyze the provided context with precision
   - If available, integrate insights from project documentation, team dynamics, and project history
   - Construct a holistic understanding of the project ecosystem
   - Identify key technologies, architectural patterns, and development practices
   - Recognize potential constraints, dependencies, and areas of complexity
   </thinking>

2. Issue Identification and Framing:
   <thinking>
   - Determine the nature of the issue (bug, feature request, refactoring, etc.)
   - Assess the scope, impact, and strategic importance
   - Consider how the issue aligns with or affects:
     * User experience and business value
     * System architecture and performance
     * Code quality and maintainability
     * Team workflow and project timeline
   - Frame the issue in a way that clearly communicates its significance and urgency
   </thinking>

3. Comprehensive Analysis and Solution Mapping:
   <thinking>
   - Dive deep into the technical aspects of the issue
   - Map out potential solutions, considering:
     * Short-term fixes vs. long-term improvements
     * Impact on existing codebase and architecture
     * Performance implications and scalability
     * Alignment with best practices and coding standards
   - Anticipate potential challenges and edge cases
   - If team information is available, consider skill sets and workload distribution
   </thinking>

4. Priority and Complexity Evaluation:
   <thinking>
   - Assess priority based on:
     * Business impact and user needs
     * Technical urgency (e.g., blocking issues, security concerns)
     * Strategic alignment with project goals
   - Evaluate complexity considering:
     * Technical challenges and unknowns
     * Scope of changes required
     * Potential ripple effects across the system
     * Required expertise and resources
   - Assign a priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and complexity (Simple, Moderate, Complex, Intricate)
   </thinking>

5. Issue Crafting:
   a. Title: Create a concise, informative title that encapsulates the essence of the issue
   b. Description: Compose a comprehensive description including:
      - Clear problem statement or feature rationale
      - Detailed technical context
      - Impact assessment
      - Reproduction steps (for bugs) or user stories (for features)
      - Current behavior vs. expected behavior
   c. Technical Specifications:
      - Affected components, services, or modules
      - Relevant code snippets or pseudocode
      - Architecture or data flow diagrams (if applicable)
   d. Acceptance Criteria:
      - Define clear, testable criteria for issue resolution
      - Include edge cases and performance expectations
   e. Proposed Solutions:
      - Outline potential approaches with pros and cons
      - Highlight preferred solution with rationale
   f. Metadata:
      - Assign appropriate labels for easy categorization
      - Suggest assignees based on expertise (if team info available)
      - Link related issues, PRs, or documentation
      - Add to relevant project board and milestone

6. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:
   - Highlight areas where team collaboration could be beneficial
   - Suggest opportunities for knowledge transfer or pair programming
   - Identify potential learning outcomes from addressing the issue
