Welcome to the **Prompt Library**. This repository contains a collection of AI prompts categorized for easy navigation and reuse. It is designed to be easily forked and customized for your own use, allowing you to create and maintain your personalized library of prompts tailored to your specific needs and use cases.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a structured framework for organizing and managing AI prompts. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this library can help you:

1. Store and categorize your prompts efficiently
2. Automatically generate metadata for your prompts
3. Easily navigate and reuse your prompt collection
4. Collaborate and share prompts with others

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This repository uses a combination of user input and automated processes to manage your prompt library:

1. **Adding Prompts**: You create `prompt.md` files in the `prompts` directory to add new prompts to your library.

2. **Version Control**: You commit and push your changes to the repository.

3. **Automated Processing**: Once changes are pushed, GitHub Actions are triggered automatically:
   - The `generate_metadata.ts` script uses the Anthropic API to analyze your prompt and generate metadata.
   - The `update_views.ts` script creates or updates the `README.md` files for each prompt and updates the main README.

4. **Repository Updates**: All changes generated by the scripts are automatically committed back to the repository.

You can monitor the progress of these automated processes in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. This tab shows you the status of all workflow runs, allowing you to track the progress of your changes and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start building your own prompt library, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

3. **Set Up Anthropic API Key**:
   - Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - Create a new repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and paste your Anthropic API key as the value.

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 22 or later recommended).
   - Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

5. **Add Your Own Prompts**:
   - Create a new file in the `prompts` directory named `prompt.md`.
   - Write your prompt content in this file.
   - Commit and push your changes to GitHub:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add new prompt: [Brief Description]"
     git push
     ```

6. **Let GitHub Actions Work**: The automated processes will generate metadata and update README files.

7. **Run Locally** (Optional):
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and update the environment variables:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     FORCE_REGENERATE=false
     LOG_LEVEL=info
     ```
   - To generate metadata for your prompts, run:
     ```
     npm run generate-metadata
     ```
   - To update the README files, run:
     ```
     npm run update-views
     ```

8. **Customize as Needed**:
   - Modify the templates in the `src/templates` directory to change how prompts are displayed.
   - Update the scripts in `src/core` to alter the metadata generation or view update process.

## üîß Customizing Metadata Extraction

The system prompt used to extract metadata from your prompts can be customized. This prompt is located at:

[`src/system_prompts/prompt_analysis_agent/prompt.md`](src/system_prompts/prompt_analysis_agent/prompt.md)

To customize the metadata extraction process:

1. Open the `prompt.md` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Review the existing prompt structure, which includes sections like `<system_role>`, `<task>`, `<input_parameters>`, `<instructions>`, and `<output>`.
3. Modify the content within these sections to adjust the behavior of the metadata extraction process. For example:
   - Update the `<instructions>` section to change how categories are assigned.
   - Modify the `<output>` section to alter the structure of the generated metadata.
   - Adapt the categories in the `Top-Level Categories` list to better suit your needs.
4. Save your changes to the file.

After modifying the prompt:

- Run `npm run generate-metadata` locally to test your changes.
- Review the generated metadata files to ensure the output meets your expectations.
- If satisfied, commit and push your changes to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

This customization allows you to tailor the metadata generation process to your specific needs or to extract additional information from your prompts. Remember that changes to this file will affect all future metadata generations, so test thoroughly before committing.

> **Note**: The `generate_metadata.ts` script in `src/core/` uses this prompt file when interacting with the Anthropic API. If you make significant changes to the prompt structure, you may need to update the script as well.
