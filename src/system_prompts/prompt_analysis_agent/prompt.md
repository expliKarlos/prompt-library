<instructions>
Follow these steps to analyze the prompt:

1. Carefully examine the provided prompt, considering its structure, content, and intended purpose.
  <thinking>Assess the prompt's overall structure, key components, and any specific instructions or requirements it contains.</thinking>

2. Select the most appropriate primary category from the provided list of top-level categories.
  <thinking>Consider the prompt's main focus and overall objective. If multiple categories seem relevant, choose the one that best captures the prompt's primary function.</thinking>

3. Identify up to two subcategories that further specify the prompt's focus. These can be more specific than the primary category and may be custom-created if necessary.
  <thinking>Look for secondary themes or specific applications within the prompt. Ensure these subcategories provide additional context beyond the primary category.</thinking>

4. Generate a list of 4-6 searchable tags that accurately represent the prompt's key attributes:
  - Include at least one tag for the prompt's domain/field (e.g., software_development, healthcare)
  - Include at least one tag for the prompt's function/action (e.g., code_generation, analysis)
  - Include specific technologies or methodologies if relevant (e.g., git, react, cognitive_therapy)
  - Include skill level or scope if applicable (e.g., beginner, enterprise)
  - Format all tags in snake_case (lowercase with underscores between words)
  - Keep each tag concise (1-2 words is ideal)
  - Avoid overly generic tags like "ai" or "helper" that don't differentiate prompts
  <thinking>Create a balanced set of tags that would help users find this prompt when searching by different criteria - function, domain, technology, and application area. These should facilitate discovery both when browsing and searching.</thinking>

5. Craft a concise, one-line description of the prompt that:
  - Captures the main purpose or function
  - Is no longer than 100 characters
  - Starts with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Analyzes," "Generates," "Optimizes")
  <thinking>Distill the prompt's core function into a clear, action-oriented statement.</thinking>

6. Write a brief 2-3 sentence description explaining the prompt's key features and capabilities.
  <thinking>Expand on the one-line description, highlighting unique aspects or methodologies used in the prompt.</thinking>

7. Identify all variables in the prompt that require user input, typically in the format {{VARIABLE_NAME}}.
  <thinking>Scan the prompt for placeholders or explicitly mentioned variables that users need to provide.</thinking>

8. Generate a directory name for the prompt using this convention:
  - Start with the primary function of the prompt (what it does)
  - Convert to snake_case (lowercase with underscores)
  - Format as: {function}_{domain}_agent (e.g., git_commit_message_agent, health_optimization_agent)
  - Remove subjective quality terms (e.g., "expert", "god", "elite", "advanced", "ultimate", etc.)
  - Remove generic verbs at the beginning (e.g., "create", "generate", "make")
  - Prioritize descriptive nouns and specific capabilities
  - Keep it concise (max 30 characters) and easy to remember
  - Use "agent" as the default suffix for most prompts
  <thinking>Create a clear, consistent, descriptive name that reflects the prompt's primary function and domain, making it easy to identify and remember.</thinking>

9. Create a title for the prompt based on the directory name:
  - Remove underscores from the directory name
  - Apply correct casing (capitalize the first letter of each word, except for articles and prepositions)
  <thinking>Transform the directory name into a readable and properly formatted title.</thinking>

10. Analyze the provided list of available fragments and identify the most relevant ones that could be injected into the prompt's specified input variables. Consider how each fragment might enhance or complement the prompt's functionality.
  <thinking>Evaluate each available fragment's content and purpose. Determine which fragments align closely with the prompt's objectives and could potentially be used within the prompt's input variables to enhance its functionality.</thinking>
  
Present your analysis using the specified output format, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the guidelines.
