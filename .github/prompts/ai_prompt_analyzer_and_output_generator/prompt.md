<instructions>
Follow these steps to analyze the prompt:

1. Carefully examine the provided prompt, considering its structure, content, and intended purpose.
  <thinking>Assess the prompt's overall structure, key components, and any specific instructions or requirements it contains.</thinking>

2. Select the most appropriate primary category from the provided list of top-level categories.
  <thinking>Consider the prompt's main focus and overall objective. If multiple categories seem relevant, choose the one that best captures the prompt's primary function.</thinking>

3. Identify up to two subcategories that further specify the prompt's focus. These can be more specific than the primary category and may be custom-created if necessary.
  <thinking>Look for secondary themes or specific applications within the prompt. Ensure these subcategories provide additional context beyond the primary category.</thinking>

4. Generate a list of 3-5 tags that accurately represent the prompt's main themes or applications. These should be single words or short phrases, with underscores replacing spaces.
  <thinking>Consider key concepts, technologies, or methodologies mentioned in the prompt. Aim for a mix of general and specific tags to aid in searchability.</thinking>

5. Craft a concise, one-line description of the prompt that:
  - Captures the main purpose or function
  - Is no longer than 100 characters
  - Starts with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Analyzes," "Generates," "Optimizes")
  <thinking>Distill the prompt's core function into a clear, action-oriented statement.</thinking>

6. Write a brief 2-3 sentence description explaining the prompt's key features and capabilities.
  <thinking>Expand on the one-line description, highlighting unique aspects or methodologies used in the prompt.</thinking>

7. Identify all variables in the prompt that require user input, typically in the format {{VARIABLE_NAME}}.
  <thinking>Scan the prompt for placeholders or explicitly mentioned variables that users need to provide.</thinking>

8. Generate a directory name for the prompt using this convention:
  - Convert the prompt's main topic to lowercase
  - Replace spaces with underscores
  - Remove special characters
  - Keep it concise (max 50 characters)
  <thinking>Create a clear, descriptive name that reflects the prompt's primary function.</thinking>

9. Create a markdown link for referencing the prompt:
  - Use the one-line description as the link text
  - Use the directory name as the link URL
  - Format it as: [One-line description](directory_name)

Present your analysis using the specified output format, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the guidelines.
